# to-do-list-app

This app is made with html, css and Jquery.

I use the Jquery to make basic functions of a to do list, which are adding a task, cross the added task, and delete the added task.

By opening the script.js file, the written comments help the viewer understand which pieces of code aplly to each functionality.

The classes necessary to create the functions are created in the js file, in order to cross with the elements already included in the html.
